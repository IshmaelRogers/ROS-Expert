The following instructions builds robot packages in ROS, from scratch. This is the methodology that I follow to successful build robots in ROS.


# Gazebo: 

1. Navigate to src directory and create a new empty package 

``` bash
$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src/
$ catkin_create_pkg hexapod0
```

2. Create folders, ``launch`` and ```worlds`` so that we can further define the structure of the package

``` bash
$ cd hexapod0
$ mkdir launch
$ mkdir worlds
```

Gazebo worlds
--

Each individual Gazebo world is saved in the ```worlds``` folder. The following commands create a simple world with no onjects or models


$ cd worlds
$ nano hexapod0.world

Add the following to hexapod0.world

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<sdf version="1.4">

  <world name="default">

    <include>
      <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
    </include>

    <!-- Light source -->
    <include>
      <uri>model://sun</uri>
    </include>

    <!-- World camera -->
    <gui fullscreen='0'>
      <camera name='world_camera'>
        <pose>4.927360 -4.376610 3.740080 0.000000 0.275643 2.356190</pose>
        <view_controller>orbit</view_controller>
      </camera>
    </gui>

  </world>
</sdf>

```


The ```.world ``` file uses the XML file format to describe all the elements that are being defined with respect to the Gazebo environment. The simple world that you are creating above, has the following elements


* ```<sdf>```: The base element which encapsulates the entire file structure and content.
  
* `` <world>``: The world element defines the world description and several properties pertaining to that world. In this example, you are adding a ground plane, a light source, and a camera to your world. Each model or property can have further elements that describe it better. For example, the ```camera``` has a ``pose`` element which defines its position and orientation.
  
* ```<include>```: The include element, along with the ``<uri>`` element, provide a path to a particular model. In Gazebo there are several models that are included by default, and you can include them in creating your environment.


Launch files 
--
Launch files in ROS allow us to execute more than one node simultaneously. This helps avoid a tedious task of defininig and launching several nodes in separate shells or terminals.

``` bash
$ cd ..
$ cd launch
$ nano hexapod0_world.launch

```
Add the following to the launch file:

``` XML 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<launch>

  <arg name="world" default="empty"/> 
  <arg name="paused" default="false"/>
  <arg name="use_sim_time" default="true"/>
  <arg name="gui" default="true"/>
  <arg name="headless" default="false"/>
  <arg name="debug" default="false"/>

  <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
    <arg name="world_name" value="$(find udacity_bot)/worlds/udacity.world"/>
    <arg name="paused" value="$(arg paused)"/>
    <arg name="use_sim_time" value="$(arg use_sim_time)"/>
    <arg name="gui" value="$(arg gui)"/>
    <arg name="headless" value="$(arg headless)"/>
    <arg name="debug" value="$(arg debug)"/>
  </include>

</launch>

```

The structure of the file aboce is divided into two parts

* Define arguments using the ``<arg>`` element. Each element will have a ``name`` attribute and a ``default`` value
* include the ``empty_world.launch`` file from the gazebo_ros package. 

[The empty_world](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/blob/kinetic-devel/gazebo_ros/launch/empty_world.launch) file includes a set of important definitions that are inherited by the world that we create. Using the world_name argument and the path to your .world file passed as the value to that argument, you will be able to launch your world in Gazebo.
